# 01. AWS Lambda

## Run Code Without Thinking About Servers

AWS Lambda is a compute service that lets you run code without provisioning or managing servers. You pay only for the compute time you consumeâ€”there is no charge when your code is not running. You can run code for virtually any type of application or backend service with zero administration.

## How Lambda Works

1.  **Upload Your Code:** You supply your code (in supported languages like Node.js, Python, Java, etc.) as a .zip file or container image.
2.  **Set a Trigger:** You configure a Lambda function to be invoked in response to an event (e.g., an HTTP request, a new file in S3, a database update).
3.  **Lambda Runs Your Code:** When triggered, Lambda executes your function by allocating compute resources based on the incoming event.
4.  **Automatic Scaling:** Lambda automatically scales your application by running code in response to each trigger, from a few requests per day to thousands per second.

## Key Features

*   **No Servers to Manage:** AWS automatically manages the underlying compute resources.
*   **Continuous Scaling:** Functions scale automatically and precisely with the size of the workload.
*   **Subsecond Metering:** You are billed for every 1ms of compute time and the number of times your code is executed.
*   **Integrated with AWS:** Can be directly triggered by over 200 AWS services.

## Common Use Cases

-   **Real-time File Processing:** Trigger a Lambda function when a file is uploaded to S3 (e.g., to create thumbnails).
-   **Real-time Stream Processing:** Process data streams from Amazon Kinesis.
-   **Web Backends:** Create RESTful APIs using Lambda and API Gateway.
-   **Scheduled Tasks (Cron):** Run functions on a schedule using Amazon EventBridge.
-   **Chatbots:** Power conversational bots for Slack, Facebook, etc.

## The Lambda Function Handler

The `handler` is the method in your code where Lambda execution begins. It processes input event data and returns a response.

```javascript
// Example Node.js handler
exports.handler = async (event) => {
    console.log('Event:', JSON.stringify(event, null, 2));
    const response = {
        statusCode: 200,
        body: JSON.stringify('Hello from Lambda!'),
    };
    return response;
};
