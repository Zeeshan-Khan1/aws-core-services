# 07. My Application Architecture

## Bringing It All Together: A Sample Cloud Architecture

Now that we've explored core AWS services, let's design a complete, modern web application architecture. This is a common pattern for a scalable, serverless application.

## Architecture Overview

This architecture will be **serverless**, meaning we use services that automatically scale and require no server management.

**Components:**
1.  **Amazon S3:** Hosts the static frontend files (HTML, CSS, JavaScript, images).
2.  **Amazon CloudFront:** A Content Delivery Network (CDN) that caches the S3 content at global edge locations for low latency and faster loading times. It also provides HTTPS using an AWS Certificate Manager (ACM) certificate.
3.  **AWS Lambda & API Gateway:** Provide the backend API. Users interact with the frontend, which calls API Gateway. API Gateway triggers Lambda functions to execute business logic (e.g., processing data, interacting with the database).
4.  **Amazon DynamoDB:** The serverless NoSQL database that stores application data. The Lambda functions read from and write to this database.

## Data Flow

1.  A user requests the website: `https://myapp.com`
2.  **CloudFront** serves the cached `index.html`, `style.css`, and `app.js` files from the nearest edge location. If not cached, it fetches them from the origin (**S3** bucket).
3.  The user interacts with the web app (e.g., clicks a button to load data).
4.  The JavaScript code in the browser makes an API call to `https://api.myapp.com/users`.
5.  **API Gateway** receives this request and triggers the **`getUsers`** **Lambda function**.
6.  The Lambda function runs, queries **DynamoDB** for the user data, and returns it.
7.  API Gateway sends the response back to the user's browser.
8.  The web app displays the data to the user.

## Why This Architecture?

*   **Highly Scalable:** Every component (S3, Lambda, DynamoDB, CloudFront) scales automatically with traffic.
*   **Cost-Effective:** You only pay for what you use. There are no charges for idle resources.
*   **Highly Available:** Built on AWS's global and resilient infrastructure.
*   **Secure:** HTTPS everywhere, fine-grained permissions with IAM, and no servers to patch.
*   **Developer Focus:** Allows developers to focus purely on application code.

## Next Steps

To build this yourself, you would:
1.  Create the S3 bucket and upload your static website files.
2.  Create the DynamoDB table.
3.  Write your Lambda functions for each API endpoint.
4.  Create an API Gateway API and link it to your Lambda functions.
5.  Set up CloudFront with your S3 bucket as the origin.
6.  Use CloudFormation or the AWS CDK to define this entire architecture as code for easy deployment.

This architecture embodies the core principles of cloud computing: elasticity, scalability, and managed services.
