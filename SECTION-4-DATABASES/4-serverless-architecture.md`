# 01. Serverless Architecture

## Building Applications Without Thinking About Servers

Serverless is a cloud-native development model that allows developers to build and run applications without having to manage servers. The name is slightly misleadingâ€”there are still servers involved, but all the server management and capacity planning is handled by the cloud provider.

## Core Principles

*   **No Server Management:** You don't provision, scale, or maintain any servers. The cloud provider does this for you.
*   **Event-Driven:** Functions are executed in response to events (e.g., an HTTP request, a file upload, a database change).
*   **Automatic Scaling:** Applications scale automatically (and instantly) from zero to thousands of concurrent executions.
*   **Pay-Per-Use:** You are billed based on the number of requests and the compute time consumed (down to the millisecond). There is no charge when your code is not running.

## Key AWS Serverless Services

*   **AWS Lambda:** The core compute service. Runs your code in response to events.
*   **Amazon API Gateway:** Creates RESTful APIs that trigger Lambda functions.
*   **Amazon DynamoDB:** A fast and flexible serverless NoSQL database.
*   **Amazon S3:** Serverless object storage.
*   **AWS Step Functions:** Coordinates multiple Lambda functions into serverless workflows.

## Benefits

1.  **Reduced Operational Overhead:** Focus on writing code, not managing infrastructure.
2.  **Built-in Scalability:** Handles traffic spikes effortlessly.
3.  **Cost Efficiency:** Eliminates costs from idle servers. You only pay for the compute time you consume.
4.  **Faster Time to Market:** Simplifies the deployment process, allowing for quicker iteration.

## Use Cases

-   **RESTful APIs:** Backends for web and mobile apps.
-   **Data Processing:** Processing files uploaded to S3 (e.g., image thumbnailing, video transcoding).
-   **Scheduled Tasks/Cron Jobs:** Running tasks at a specific time.
-   **Chatbots:** Backend logic for conversational interfaces.
-   **IoT Backends:** Processing data from IoT sensors.

## The "Serverless" Mindset

The goal is to break down your application into small, single-purpose **functions** that are triggered by **events**. This is often called **Function-as-a-Service (FaaS)**.
